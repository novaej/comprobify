# Code Flow — SRI Electronic Invoice API

A top-down walkthrough of how a request travels through every layer of the system, and why each piece was built the way it was.

---

## 1. Entry point — `app.js`

```
app.js
  → require('dotenv').config()
  → new Server()
  → server.listen()
```

`app.js` is intentionally minimal — three lines. Its only job is to load environment variables before any other `require` runs (so `process.env` is populated when `config/index.js` is evaluated), then hand off to the `Server` class.

**Why dotenv first?** Node evaluates `require` calls synchronously and caches modules. If `config/index.js` ran before `dotenv.config()`, all the `process.env.*` reads would return `undefined` and the cached defaults would be wrong for the entire process lifetime.

---

## 2. Server class — `src/server.js`

```js
class Server {
  constructor() {
    this.middlewares();   // 1. Parse + CORS
    this.routes();        // 2. Mount API routes
    this.errorHandling(); // 3. Mount error handler LAST
  }
}
```

The Express app lives inside a class rather than a bare module-level variable. This makes the server importable and instantiable in tests without side effects.

The constructor calls three setup methods in a fixed order because Express is an ordered middleware stack — the error handler must be registered after all routes, or it will never receive errors thrown inside them.

**Middlewares registered:**
- `cors()` — allows the API to be called from browser clients on other origins.
- `express.json()` — parses `Content-Type: application/json` bodies into `req.body`. Without this, `req.body` is always `undefined`.
- `express.static('public')` — serves any static files from `/public` (reserved for future use, e.g. RIDE PDFs).

---

## 3. Configuration — `src/config/index.js`

```js
const config = { port, environment, db: {...}, sri: {...} };
config.sri.baseUrl = environment === '2' ? prodUrl : testUrl;
config.sri.receptionUrl = `${baseUrl}/RecepcionComprobantesOffline?wsdl`;
config.sri.authorizationUrl = `${baseUrl}/AutorizacionComprobantesOffline?wsdl`;
module.exports = config;
```

All environment variables are read once here and exported as a plain object. No other file reads `process.env` directly.

**Why centralise config?** If a variable name changes in `.env` there is exactly one place to update. It also makes it easy to see every configurable value at a glance, and makes mocking config in tests trivial.

The SRI URLs are derived at startup based on `environment` (`'1'` = test, `'2'` = production). This way the rest of the code never needs to know which environment it is in — it just calls `config.sri.receptionUrl`.

---

## 4. Database pool — `src/config/database.js`

```js
const pool = new Pool({ ...config.db, max: 20, idleTimeoutMillis: 30000 });
const query = (text, params) => pool.query(text, params);
const getClient = () => pool.connect();
module.exports = { pool, query, getClient };
```

A single `pg.Pool` is created once and shared across the entire process. The pool maintains up to 20 idle connections and reuses them across requests.

**Why a pool and not a single client?** A single client would be blocked while waiting for slow queries (e.g. SRI SOAP responses that arrive before a DB write). The pool lets concurrent requests each get their own connection.

`query` wraps `pool.query` — good for single statements where automatic connection management is fine. `getClient` returns a dedicated connection that the caller controls — required for explicit transactions (`BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK`).

---

## 5. Routes — `src/routes/`

```
src/routes/index.js          → mounts /documents
src/routes/documents.routes.js  → defines the endpoints
```

The top-level `index.js` is a simple aggregator. Adding a new resource (e.g. `/api/credit-notes`) means adding one line here without touching anything else.

Each route in `documents.routes.js` follows the same pattern:

```
authenticate  →  [optional middleware]  →  [validator chain]  →  validateRequest  →  asyncHandler(controller.fn)
```

`authenticate` is mounted first via `router.use(asyncHandler(authenticate))` at the top of the router, so every endpoint in the file requires a valid API key before any other middleware runs.

**Why this pattern?**

- **`authenticate`**: verifies the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and sets `req.issuer` before any business logic runs. Centralising authentication at the router level means no endpoint can accidentally be reached unauthenticated.
- **Optional middleware** (e.g. `extractIdempotencyKey`): thin, synchronous header extraction that runs before body validation. Keeps HTTP-level concerns out of the controller.
- **Validator chain** (`express-validator`): declarative field rules applied before the controller runs. Keeps validation logic out of the controller.
- **`validateRequest` middleware**: reads the validation result from the chain and throws a `ValidationError` if any field failed. Keeps the controller clean — it never sees invalid input.
- **`asyncHandler` wrapper**: wraps the async controller function in a try/catch that calls `next(err)` on rejection. Without this, unhandled promise rejections in async route handlers crash silently in older Express versions (Express 4 does not catch them automatically).

---

## 6. Validators — `src/validators/invoice.validator.js`

The `createInvoice` array contains `express-validator` chain calls that validate every field of the request body: buyer identity (including `buyer.email` as a required field), items (quantity, unit price, discount, taxes), payments, and optional `documentType`.

**Why express-validator and not manual checks in the controller?** The chain is declarative and co-located with the route. It produces structured error objects (field + message + value) that the error handler can return directly to the caller, making API errors machine-readable.

---

## 7. Authentication middleware — `src/middleware/authenticate.js`

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
  │
  ├── missing header or wrong scheme → AppError 401
  ├── SHA-256(token) → keyHash
  ├── apiKeyModel.findByKeyHash(keyHash)  (JOINs api_keys with issuers)
  │     └── not found → AppError 401
  └── req.issuer = full issuer row (id, ruc, encrypted_private_key, certificate_pem, cert_fingerprint, cert_expiry, ...)
```

Every protected route calls this middleware before anything else. It reads the `Authorization` header, computes `SHA-256(token)` as `keyHash`, and calls `apiKeyModel.findByKeyHash(keyHash)` which performs a JOIN between `api_keys` and `issuers`. If the key exists, the full issuer row is attached to `req.issuer` for downstream use.

**Why SHA-256 and not bcrypt?** API keys are 256-bit random strings — they are not guessable like user passwords. The bcrypt slowdown exists to prevent brute-force dictionary attacks, which are not a concern for a token with `2^256` possible values. SHA-256 comparison is fast and secure for long random tokens, while bcrypt would add 100–300 ms of unnecessary latency to every request.

**Why set `req.issuer` here?** It eliminates `issuerModel.findFirst()` from every service. Each service receives the issuer as a parameter and never queries the DB for it — the tenant is already known by the time the controller runs.

**Why store `encrypted_private_key` and `certificate_pem` in `issuers`?** Moving from filesystem-based P12 files to database-stored PEM eliminates the need to ship certificate files with deployments, simplifies multi-branch cert sharing (copy the encrypted columns, no file duplication), and keeps all issuer configuration in one place. The private key PEM is AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest; the certificate PEM is stored plaintext (public material). The plaintext password for the P12 is never persisted — only the extracted and encrypted private key PEM is stored.

---

## 8. Controllers — `src/controllers/documents.controller.js`

```js
const create = async (req, res) => {
  const { document, created } = await documentCreation.create(req.body, req.idempotencyKey, req.issuer);
  res.status(created ? 201 : 200).json({ ok: true, document });
};
```

Controllers are intentionally thin — one call to the appropriate service, one response. They know about HTTP (status codes, `req`, `res`) but nothing about business logic, XML, SRI, or the database.

The controller imports from multiple focused services (`documentCreation`, `documentTransmission`, `documentRebuild`, `documentEmail`, `documentQuery`) rather than a single monolith. Each import handles one phase of the lifecycle.

**Why keep controllers thin?** It makes business logic testable without an HTTP layer. It also makes it trivial to change the transport (e.g. add a CLI command or a queue worker) without duplicating logic.

The only business decision a controller makes is: `404 NotFoundError` when `getByAccessKey` returns null — because "not found" is HTTP knowledge, not service knowledge.

---

## 9. Error hierarchy — `src/errors/`

```
AppError         — base: message + statusCode + isOperational flag
  ├── ValidationError  — 400, carries array of field errors
  ├── NotFoundError    — 404
  └── SriError         — 502, carries SRI SOAP message array
```

**Why a typed error hierarchy?** The error handler (`src/middleware/error-handler.js`) uses `instanceof AppError` to distinguish expected operational errors (validation failures, not-found, SRI rejections) from unexpected programming errors. Operational errors get their specific status code and message forwarded to the caller. Unexpected errors get a generic 500 with only an internal `console.error` — no stack trace leaks to the client.

The `isOperational` flag exists for future use: a process monitor could check it to decide whether to restart the process after a crash.

---

## 10. Error handler — `src/middleware/error-handler.js`

```js
const errorHandler = (err, _req, res, _next) => {
  if (err instanceof AppError) {
    const body = { ok: false, message: err.message };
    if (err.errors)      body.errors = err.errors;         // ValidationError
    if (err.sriMessages) body.sriMessages = err.sriMessages; // SriError
    return res.status(err.statusCode).json(body);
  }
  console.error('Unhandled error:', err);
  res.status(500).json({ ok: false, message: 'Internal server error' });
};
```

Registered last in the Express chain (four-argument signature). It is the single place where all errors in the system are translated into HTTP responses.

The `ok: false` / `ok: true` convention on all responses lets callers check a single field without parsing status codes.

---

## 11. Document Services — `src/services/`

The original monolith (`document.service.js`) was split into five focused services. Each service handles one phase of the document lifecycle. All services receive `issuer` as a parameter — they never look up the issuer themselves.

### `document-creation.service.js` — POST /api/documents

Step-by-step:

```
0. [If Idempotency-Key header present]
   documentModel.findByIdempotencyKey(key)
   → Found + hash matches  → return existing document, created=false (200, no transaction opened)
   → Found + hash differs  → throw ConflictError 409
   → Not found             → compute payloadHash = SHA-256(body), continue

1. Open explicit PostgreSQL transaction (BEGIN)

2. sequentialService.getNext(issuerId, branchCode, issuePointCode, documentType, client)
   → SELECT FOR UPDATE inside the transaction — guarantees no duplicate sequentials.

3. accessKeyService.generate({...})
   → 49-digit SRI key: date + docType + RUC + environment + branch + sequential + Module 11 check digit.

4. getBuilder(documentType, issuer).build(body, accessKey, sequential)
   → Constructs the unsigned XML tree (infoTributaria + infoFactura + detalles + pagos).

5. Validate payments total matches builder.total (early fail before XSD)

6. xmlValidator.validate(unsignedXml)   [async]
   → Writes tmp file, runs xmllint --schema, deletes tmp file.
   → Throws ValidationError with XSD errors if invalid.

7. signingService.signXml(unsignedXml, issuer.encrypted_private_key, issuer.certificate_pem)
   → Decrypt private key PEM → XAdES-BES sign.

8. documentModel.create({ ..., idempotencyKey, payloadHash }, client)
   → INSERT into documents with all fields including buyer_email from body.buyer.email.
   → On 23505 unique violation (concurrent idempotency race): ROLLBACK, fetch winner, return created=false.

9. documentLineItemModel.bulkCreate(documentId, items, client)
   → Single multi-row INSERT into document_line_items.

10. documentEventModel.create(documentId, 'CREATED', null, 'SIGNED', {...}, client)
    → First audit log entry.

11. COMMIT
12. Return { document: formatDocument(document), created: true }
```

**Why `documentType` from the payload?** The document type is a required field — the creation service reads it directly from `body.documentType` with no default fallback. The builder registry maps the code to the correct builder class.

**Why buyer email is a required top-level field:** `body.buyer.email` is validated by the validator chain. It is no longer buried in `additionalInfo` — that extraction was a workaround removed in Phase 0.

**Why validate before signing?** Signing is the most expensive operation (P12 load + RSA crypto). Failing fast on XSD errors avoids wasting that time on a document that SRI would reject anyway.

**Why store both unsigned and signed XML?** The unsigned XML is useful for debugging schema issues. The signed XML is what gets sent to SRI. Keeping both means you can re-inspect the document at any time without re-building.

**Why SHA-256 for payload comparison?** Fetching the full JSONB `request_payload` from the DB and doing a deep JS equality check on every retry would be wasteful. A 64-character hex hash stored in a `TEXT` column is a constant-time comparison that adds zero query overhead.

**Why handle the 23505 race in the catch block?** Two concurrent requests with the same key can both pass the pre-transaction lookup (neither row exists yet) and race to the `INSERT`. The partial unique index guarantees only one wins. The loser catches the `23505` error code, rolls back, fetches the winner, and returns it — so the caller gets the correct `200` replay instead of a confusing `500`.

---

### `document-transmission.service.js` — POST /:key/send + GET /:key/authorize

**`sendToSri(accessKey, issuer)`**

```
1. findByAccessKey(accessKey, issuer.id)   — tenant-scoped
2. assertTransition(document.status, DocumentStatus.RECEIVED)
   → Throws AppError 400 if status is not SIGNED (the only valid predecessor of RECEIVED/RETURNED)
3. sriService.sendReceipt(signedXml, issuer.environment)   SOAP call with retry
   → On network throw: log ERROR event, re-throw
4. sriResponseModel.create(...)   persist raw SOAP response
5. newStatus = result.status === 'RECIBIDA' ? RECEIVED : RETURNED
6. documentModel.updateStatus(id, newStatus)
7. documentEventModel.create('SENT', ...)
8. Return formatDocument(updated)
```

**`checkAuthorization(accessKey, issuer)`**

```
1. findByAccessKey(accessKey, issuer.id)
2. assertTransition(document.status, DocumentStatus.AUTHORIZED)
   → Throws AppError 400 if status is not RECEIVED
3. sriService.checkAuthorization(accessKey, issuer.environment)   SOAP call
   → unescapeXml(comprobante) decodes &lt; &gt; &amp; etc. from the SOAP envelope
   → On network throw: log ERROR event, re-throw
4. sriResponseModel.create(...)
5. [result.pending] → return current document unchanged
6. newStatus = result.status === 'AUTORIZADO' ? AUTHORIZED : NOT_AUTHORIZED
7. documentModel.updateStatus(id, newStatus, extraFields)
   extraFields [AUTHORIZED]: authorization_number, authorization_date, authorization_xml
8. documentEventModel.create('STATUS_CHANGED', ...)
9. [AUTHORIZED] emailService.sendInvoiceAuthorized(updated)  [fire-and-forget]
   → On success: updateStatus({ email_status: 'SENT' }) + EMAIL_SENT event
   → On no email: updateStatus({ email_status: 'SKIPPED' })
   → On failure: updateStatus({ email_status: 'FAILED', email_error }) + EMAIL_FAILED event
10. Return formatDocument(updated)
```

**Why fire-and-forget for email?** The buyer notification is a convenience feature — it must not block or fail the authorization response. The document is already `AUTHORIZED` in the DB before the email is attempted. Failed sends are retried via `POST /email-retry` or `POST /:accessKey/email-retry`.

**Why keep send and authorize as separate API calls?** SRI's offline reception API (`RecepcionComprobantesOffline`) is fire-and-accept: it validates structure and queues the document but does not authorize it immediately. Authorization requires a separate SOAP call to `AutorizacionComprobantesOffline`. The two-step split mirrors SRI's own protocol.

---

### `document-rebuild.service.js` — POST /:key/rebuild

Used when SRI returns `RETURNED` (structural issue) or `NOT_AUTHORIZED` (content issue, e.g. wrong tax rate). The same access key and sequential are reused — SRI specs allow fixing and resubmitting with the same identity.

```
1. findByAccessKey(accessKey, issuer.id)
2. assertTransition(document.status, DocumentStatus.SIGNED)
   → Valid from RETURNED or NOT_AUTHORIZED only
3. Preserve issue_date, access_key, sequential, document_type from stored document
4. getBuilder(document.document_type, issuer).build({ ...body, issueDate }, access_key, sequential)
5. Validate payments total matches builder total
6. xmlValidator.validate(unsignedXml)
7. signingService.signXml(...)
8. documentModel.updateStatus('SIGNED', {
     unsigned_xml, signed_xml, request_payload, subtotal, total,
     buyer_id, buyer_name, buyer_id_type
   })
9. documentEventModel.create('REBUILT', oldStatus, 'SIGNED', {})
10. Return formatDocument(updated)
```

After `rebuild`, the document is back in `SIGNED` status and can be sent with `POST /:key/send` again.

---

### `document-email.service.js` — POST /email-retry + POST /:key/email-retry

Retry email sends that failed during the fire-and-forget `checkAuthorization` flow, or resend an already-sent email with `?force=true`.

`retryFailedEmails(issuer)`: queries all `AUTHORIZED` documents with `email_status IN ('PENDING', 'FAILED')` scoped by `issuer_id`, retries each one, returns `{ sent, failed }` counts.

`retrySingleEmail(accessKey, { force }, issuer)`: checks status is `AUTHORIZED`, checks no email → SKIPPED, checks `email_status === 'SENT' && !force` → early return (no re-send). Otherwise sends, updates `email_status`, logs event.

---

### `document-query.service.js` — GET /:key, GET /:key/xml, GET /:key/events

Three read-only operations, all tenant-scoped via `issuer.id`:

- `getByAccessKey(accessKey, issuer)` → `formatDocument(doc)` or null
- `getXml(accessKey, issuer)` → `authorization_xml || signed_xml` with `application/xml` content type
- `getEvents(accessKey, issuer)` → array of camelCase event objects from `document_events`

---

### `document.presenter.js` — `src/presenters/document.presenter.js`

`formatDocument(doc)` is the single place that maps a raw PostgreSQL row to the API response shape:

```js
{
  accessKey:           doc.access_key,
  documentType:        doc.document_type,
  sequential:          String(doc.sequential).padStart(9, '0'),
  status:              doc.status,
  issueDate:           moment(doc.issue_date).format('DD/MM/YYYY'),
  total:               doc.total,
  authorizationNumber: ...,   // only if present
  authorizationDate:   ...,   // only if present
  email: {
    status:  doc.email_status || 'PENDING',
    sentAt:  ...,             // only if present
    error:   ...,             // only if present
  },
}
```

Used by all five services — there is exactly one place to change the response shape.

---

### Document state machine — `src/constants/document-state-machine.js`

The full lifecycle state graph:

```
SIGNED → RECEIVED (send accepted by SRI)
SIGNED → RETURNED (send rejected by SRI)
RECEIVED → AUTHORIZED (checkAuthorization: approved)
RECEIVED → NOT_AUTHORIZED (checkAuthorization: rejected)
RETURNED → SIGNED (rebuild)
NOT_AUTHORIZED → SIGNED (rebuild)
AUTHORIZED → (terminal — no further transitions)
```

`assertTransition(from, to)` is called at the top of each service operation. It throws `AppError(400)` with `"Invalid state transition: X → Y"` if the transition is not in the allowed graph. This replaces the scattered `if (status !== X)` checks that previously existed across the monolith.

The same graph is enforced at the PostgreSQL level by `trg_document_state_transition` (migration 027) as defense in depth. `trg_document_immutability` (migration 026) additionally protects permanently immutable columns (`access_key`, `sequential`, `issuer_id`, etc.) and set-once authorization fields.

---

## 12. SequentialService — `src/services/sequential.service.js`

```js
await client.query('BEGIN');
SELECT current_value FROM sequential_numbers
  WHERE issuer_id=$1 AND branch_code=$2 AND issue_point_code=$3 AND document_type=$4
  FOR UPDATE;          ← row-level lock
UPDATE sequential_numbers SET current_value = next ...;
await client.query('COMMIT');
```

**Why `SELECT FOR UPDATE`?** Without the lock, two concurrent requests could both read the same `current_value`, both compute the same next value, and produce two invoices with duplicate sequential numbers. `FOR UPDATE` makes the second transaction wait until the first commits, guaranteeing uniqueness. PostgreSQL row-level locks are efficient — only the specific counter row is locked, not the whole table.

The service auto-creates the counter row on first use (`INSERT` if no row found) so there is no need to pre-seed the table.

---

## 13. AccessKeyService — `src/services/access-key.service.js`

Thin wrapper around `helpers/access-key-generator.js`. Translates between the service layer's camelCase arguments and the helper's expected signature.

**Why a wrapper instead of calling the helper directly?** The wrapper gives the service layer a clean interface and isolates tests — services mock `accessKeyService.generate`, not the helper internals.

The 49-digit access key is structured as:

```
DDMMYYYY  (8) — issue date
01        (2) — document type (01 = factura)
1712345678001 (13) — issuer RUC
1         (1) — environment (1=test, 2=prod)
001001    (6) — branch code + issue point
000000263 (9) — zero-padded sequential
00000263  (8) — numeric code
X         (1) — Module 11 check digit
```

---

## 14. Builders — `src/builders/`

```
builders/index.js         → registry: { '01': InvoiceBuilder }
builders/base.builder.js  → buildInfoTributaria(), toXml()
builders/invoice.builder.js → buildInfoFactura(), buildDetalles(), buildAdditionalInfo()
```

**Why a builder registry?** The creation and rebuild services call `getBuilder(documentTypeCode, issuer)` and get back a builder without knowing which class it is. Adding a new document type (e.g. `'04'` credit note) requires only registering a new class — no changes to the services.

`BaseDocumentBuilder` holds the XML root attributes (`id="comprobante"`, `version="2.1.0"`) and the `infoTributaria` block, which is identical for all SRI document types. Namespace declarations (`xmlns:ds`, `xmlns:etsi`) are intentionally absent from the root element — they are injected by the signer directly onto `<ds:Signature>` to avoid inclusive C14N namespace pollution that would invalidate the digest.

`InvoiceBuilder.build()` is the main method — it calls all the sub-builders in the SRI-required XML element order and returns the serialized XML string via `toXml()` which uses `js2xmlparser` to convert the JS object tree to XML.

The builder stores `this.subtotal` and `this.total` as side effects of `buildInfoFactura()` so the service can read them for the DB row without re-calculating.

---

## 15. XmlValidatorService — `src/services/xml-validator.service.js`

```js
function validate(xmlString) {
  const tmpFile = path.join(os.tmpdir(), `sri-validate-${process.pid}-${Date.now()}.xml`);
  try {
    fs.writeFileSync(tmpFile, xmlString, 'utf8');
    execFileSync('xmllint', ['--noout', '--schema', XSD_PATH, tmpFile], {
      stdio: ['ignore', 'ignore', 'pipe'],
    });
    return { valid: true };
  } catch (err) {
    const stderr = err.stderr ? err.stderr.toString().trim() : err.message;
    const errors = stderr
      .split('\n')
      .filter((line) => line.includes('error') || line.includes('invalid'))
      .map((line) => ({ message: line.trim() }));
    return { valid: false, errors: errors.length ? errors : [{ message: stderr }] };
  } finally {
    try { fs.unlinkSync(tmpFile); } catch (_) { /* ignore cleanup errors */ }
  }
}
```

**Why `xmllint` instead of an npm package?** The Node.js XSD validation ecosystem is sparse and largely unmaintained (`libxmljs2` was end-of-life). `xmllint` is part of the system `libxml2` installation — the same C library those npm packages wrap — actively maintained by the OS, and available everywhere (pre-installed on macOS, available via `libxml2-utils` on Ubuntu/Debian). Zero npm footprint and no native rebuild issues across Node.js versions.

**Why a temp file?** `xmllint --schema` requires a file path for the document being validated; it does not accept stdin when a schema is involved. The file is always deleted in the `finally` block regardless of outcome.

**Why `--noout`?** Suppresses the serialised XML output — only the validation result and errors on stderr matter.

**Why validate before signing, not after?** If the XML is schema-invalid, SRI will reject it at reception. Catching it before signing saves the crypto cost and returns a clear 400 error to the caller with the specific XSD violation, instead of a cryptic SRI SOAP fault after the round-trip.

---

## 16. SigningService — `src/services/signing.service.js`

```js
function signXml(xmlString, encryptedPrivateKey, certPem) {
  const privateKeyPem = cryptoService.decrypt(encryptedPrivateKey);
  return sign(privateKeyPem, certPem, xmlString);
}
```

Thin wrapper around `helpers/signer.js` (XAdES-BES signing via `node-forge`). Its only responsibility is to decrypt the AES-256-GCM-encrypted private key PEM before passing it (together with the plaintext certificate PEM) to the signing helper.

`helpers/signer.js` produces a valid XAdES-BES signature with:
- **RSA-SHA256** for the signature and all digests (not SHA-1)
- **2 References** in SignedInfo: `#comprobante` (enveloped, with enveloped-signature transform) then `#SignedProperties`
- **KeyInfo** contains only `X509Certificate` — no `RSAKeyValue`, no KeyInfo reference
- **Inclusive C14N** (C14N 1.0) applied by injecting `xmlns:ds` and `xmlns:etsi` directly on the element being digested
- **Issuer DN** formatted without spaces after commas (`CN=...,OU=...,O=...,C=EC`) to match Java-based SRI tooling

**Why wrap the helper?** Same reason as `accessKeyService` — isolates tests and keeps the service layer from knowing about the helper's internal API.

---

## 17. CryptoService — `src/services/crypto.service.js`

```
Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
Stored format: hex(iv) + ':' + hex(authTag) + ':' + hex(ciphertext)
```

**Why AES-256-GCM?** GCM mode provides both encryption and authenticated integrity — any tampering with the stored ciphertext causes decryption to throw rather than silently returning garbage. The 256-bit key makes brute-force infeasible. A fresh random IV is generated for every `encrypt()` call so the same password never produces the same ciphertext twice.

**Why store the private key PEM encrypted instead of the P12 on disk?** The P12 file on disk combines the private key and certificate in a single password-protected bundle. Once extracted, the private key PEM is encrypted with AES-256-GCM keyed by `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (env var) and stored in `issuers.encrypted_private_key`. The certificate PEM (public material) is stored plaintext in `issuers.certificate_pem`. This removes the need to ship certificate files with deployments, makes multi-branch cert sharing a simple column copy, and means exploiting the DB alone is not sufficient — the attacker also needs the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the server environment.

---

## 18. SriService — `src/services/sri.service.js`

Handles the two SRI SOAP endpoints. Both calls go through `fetchWithRetry`:

```js
async function fetchWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fetch(url, options);
    } catch (err) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw err;
      const delay = 1000 * 2 ** (attempt - 1); // 1s → 2s → 4s
      console.warn(`SRI fetch attempt ${attempt} failed, retrying in ${delay}ms`);
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, delay));
    }
  }
}
```

**Why retry only on `fetch` throws and not on HTTP 4xx/5xx?** A thrown error means the TCP connection failed or timed out — a transient network problem worth retrying. An HTTP 4xx/5xx means SRI received and responded to the request — the document was already processed by SRI and retrying would likely produce the same response or cause a duplicate. The `if (!response.ok)` check below the fetch throws a `SriError` for HTTP-level failures without retrying.

**Why exponential backoff?** If SRI's server is temporarily overloaded, hammering it with immediate retries makes the overload worse. Doubling the wait time gives the server a chance to recover. After three attempts (7 seconds total), the error is surfaced to the caller as a `SriError`.

**Response parsing** uses regex-based tag extraction (`extractTagContent`, `extractAllTags`) rather than a full XML parser — the SRI SOAP envelopes are simple and predictable, and importing a full SOAP library for two endpoints would be over-engineering.

## 19. Models — `src/models/`

All models use parameterized queries exclusively (`$1, $2, ...`) — never string interpolation. This is the primary SQL injection defense.

| Model | Table | Key operations |
|---|---|---|
| `issuer.model` | `issuers` | `findById`, `findByRuc`, `create` |
| `api-key.model` | `api_keys` | `findByKeyHash` (JOINs issuers), `create`, `revoke`, `revokeAllByIssuerId` |
| `document.model` | `documents` | `create`, `findByAccessKey(accessKey, issuerId)`, `findById`, `updateStatus` (column-whitelisted), `findPendingEmails(issuerId)`, `findByIdempotencyKey` |
| (no model) | `sequential_numbers` | managed directly by `sequential.service` |
| `sri-response.model` | `sri_responses` | `create`, `findByDocumentId` |
| `document-line-item.model` | `document_line_items` | `bulkCreate` (single multi-row INSERT) |
| `document-event.model` | `document_events` | `create`, `findByDocumentId` |

`issuer.model` no longer exposes `findFirst()` — issuers are always loaded via `apiKeyModel.findByKeyHash()` during authentication and passed as `req.issuer` to services. There is no "load the active issuer" step anywhere in the creation or transmission flow.

**Why raw `pg` instead of an ORM?** The queries are straightforward and the SRI lifecycle is domain-specific enough that the mapping overhead of an ORM adds more complexity than it removes. Raw `pg` queries are readable, debuggable, and do exactly what they say.

**`updateStatus` dynamic builder** (`document.model`):

```js
const sets = ['status = $2', 'updated_at = NOW()'];
for (const [col, val] of Object.entries(extraFields)) {
  sets.push(`${col} = $${idx}`);
}
```

The column names in `extraFields` are validated against a `MUTABLE_EXTRA_COLUMNS` Set (a whitelist of allowed column names) before the SET clause is built. If a caller passes an unknown column name, `updateStatus` throws rather than silently executing a malformed query. All values go through parameterized placeholders regardless.

---

## 20. Document events — audit trail

Every state change in a document's lifecycle produces a row in `document_events`:

| Event | Triggered by |
|---|---|
| `CREATED` | After `documentModel.create` in `create()` |
| `SENT` | After `documentModel.updateStatus` in `sendToSri()` |
| `STATUS_CHANGED` | After `documentModel.updateStatus` in `checkAuthorization()` |
| `ERROR` | In the catch block of both SRI service calls |
| `REBUILT` | After `documentModel.updateStatus` in `rebuild()` |
| `EMAIL_SENT` | After successful email delivery (fire-and-forget in `checkAuthorization`, or explicit retry) |
| `EMAIL_FAILED` | After failed email delivery — `detail` contains `{ error }` or `{ to, error }` |

The `from_status` / `to_status` columns make it possible to reconstruct the exact history of a document without reading multiple tables. The `detail` JSONB column carries context (access key, SRI status, authorization number, error message) without needing extra columns for every possible scenario.

## 21. Database schema overview

```
issuers (1)
  ├── api_keys (N)             ← one per API credential
  ├── documents (N)            ← one per invoice
  │     ├── document_line_items ← one per line item
  │     ├── document_events    ← one per lifecycle transition
  │     └── sri_responses      ← one per SRI SOAP call
  └── sequential_numbers (N)   ← one per branch/point/docType combination
```

All child tables reference `issuers(id)` directly or via `documents(id)`, enabling multi-tenant filtering with a simple `WHERE issuer_id = $1`.

---

## 22. RideService — `src/services/ride.service.js`

Generates the RIDE (Representación Impresa del Documento Electrónico) PDF for an `AUTHORIZED` document on demand. No PDF is persisted — it is generated fresh on every request.

```
1. documentModel.findByAccessKey(accessKey, issuer.id)   — tenant-scoped
   → Throws NotFoundError 404 if not found.
   → Throws AppError 400 if status !== 'AUTHORIZED'.

2. issuerModel.findById(issuer.id)
   → Loads issuer fields (RUC, business_name, trade_name, addresses,
     logo_path, special_taxpayer, required_accounting, emission_type).

3. Resolve catalog labels (one-time DB query per table, then Map cache):
   → catalogModel.getIdTypeLabel(buyer_id_type)        → e.g. 'Cédula'
   → catalogModel.getPaymentMethodLabel(method)         → per payment
   → catalogModel.getTaxRateDescription(code, rateCode) → per distinct tax key

4. Assemble rideData plain object from document, issuer, and document.request_payload

5. rideBuilder.build(rideData)   → Promise<Buffer>
   → PDFKit A4 renderer (see helpers/ride-builder.js)
   → Returns raw PDF bytes as a Node Buffer

6. Return buffer to controller → sent as application/pdf
```

**Why generate on-the-fly?** RIDE PDFs are only needed for `AUTHORIZED` documents. Generating on demand avoids storage overhead and ensures the PDF always reflects the current DB state (authorization number, date). PDFs are typically small (< 100 KB) and generation is fast.

**Tax computation** — amounts are re-derived from payload fields (`qty × unitPrice − discount`) rather than stored pre-computed values. Rate codes (`'0'`=0%, `'6'`=No objeto, `'7'`=Exento) are used as the authoritative classifier — never rate values, which are the same (0) for all three categories.

**`helpers/ride-builder.js`** — PDFKit A4 layout engine. Uses `doc.heightOfString()` to pre-measure all variable-height content (additional info rows, payment labels) before drawing enclosing boxes, preventing overflow. All coordinates are explicit (x, y) — the internal PDFKit cursor is never relied upon for multi-column layout.
